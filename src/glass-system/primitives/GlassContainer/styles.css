/**
 * Border glow effect - DEPRECATED
 * 
 * Now using box-shadow + border-image approach directly in component styles.
 * This file is kept for reference but the CSS mask technique is no longer used.
 * 
 * The new approach:
 * - box-shadow for outer glow (immediately visible)
 * - border-image for gradient border (CSS native)
 * - inset box-shadow for inner highlight
 * 
 * See GlassContainer.tsx for implementation.
